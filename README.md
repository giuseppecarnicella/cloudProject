# 🎨 Selective Colorization with AWS Lambda

## 📖 Project Overview

This project implements a **serverless image processing function** using **AWS Lambda**, capable of performing **selective colorization** on uploaded images. The function converts all colors in an image to grayscale, except for a user-specified color, which is preserved in its original form.

This technique is commonly used in photography and design to highlight key elements and draw viewer attention. By leveraging AWS Lambda, the solution is lightweight, cost-effective, and scalable — ideal for on-demand image manipulation in the cloud.
